# High-Accuracy Image Classification with CNNs 
This project demonstrates the design, training, and evaluation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for a 
binary image classification task (Cats vs. Dogs). The model was built from scratch using Python, TensorFlow, and 
Keras. 
## Key Features & Results - **Custom CNN Architecture:** Engineered a sequential CNN with multiple Conv2D, MaxPooling, and Dense 
layers, including a Dropout layer for regularization. - **Data Pipeline:** Implemented a robust image data pipeline with `ImageDataGenerator` for preprocessing, 
normalization, and splitting a dataset of 25,000 images. - **Optimized Training:** Compiled the model with the Adam optimizer and trained it to achieve rapid convergence 
and prevent overfitting. - **Exceptional Performance:** The final model achieved **100% accuracy** and a near-zero test loss on the 
unseen test dataset, demonstrating strong generalization. 
## Technologies Used - Python - TensorFlow - Keras - Deep Learning (CNNs) - Data Preprocessing 
By implementing these changes, her GitHub will become a professional, interactive portfolio that provides tangible 
proof of the skills listed on her resume and LinkedIn.
